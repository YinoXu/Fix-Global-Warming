* Introduction
The Earth migration program is a proposed initiative designed to combat global warming by reducing the Earth's temperature by approximately one degree Celsius. The project would involve relocating Earth a specific distance away from the Sun to achieve this goal.The following tasks are related to physics and must be performed:
 * Assume that the rightmost point of Earth's orbit is the starting point of the simulation.
 * Adjust the distance $c$ to move Earth away from its starting point and simulate five new orbits based on the new distance $r$ from the Sun at each time unit.
 * Use the temperature equation that relates the distance of Earth to the Sun to calculate the temperature of Earth at each time unit.
 * Plot the different temperatures of Earth with respect to the time unit.
 * Compute the average temperature of Earth for each of the five different orbits, compare the results and find the new orbit that reduces Earth's average temperature by exactly $1^\circ$.

The project could serve as a thought experiment to help us better understand the challenges and complexities of such a task, and highlight the importance of finding more practical solutions to address global warming.
